# MIL-88B_101

This folder contains the converted files generated from the original CSV dataset for the synthesis of MIL-88B and MIL-101.

Disclaimer regarding the XDL output:
The document `xdl_from_MIL` contains all the different synthesis procedures of the dataset following the [XDL 2.0 standard](https://croningroup.gitlab.io/chemputer/xdl/standard/index.html).
To properly use within the Chemputer ecosystem, extract individual synthesis procedures into separate files.
Furthermore, the Cronin group is currently working on a major revamp of the XDL standard.
Incompatibility with the output and ChemIDE may arise in the future.
Then the export script to XDL should be updated accordingly.
