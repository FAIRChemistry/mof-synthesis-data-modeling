# Data Model

This folder contains the JSON Schemas for this project.


## Sciformation ELN Cleaned Schema

This is the schema of an intermediate step of our chain: the schema for a Sciformation ELN Export that has been cleaned up.
Data in this format is then used in a next step to export to JXDL.

Explore or edit the schema [here](https://metaconfigurator.github.io/meta-configurator/?schema=https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/FAIRSynthesis/blob/main/data-model/sciformation_eln_cleaned.schema.json).
After clicking the link, navigate to the `Schema Editor` tab in the top left menu bar.


## MOFSY

MOFSY is based on a subset of [XDL](https://croningroup.gitlab.io/chemputer/xdl/standard/index.html) focused on MOF Synthesis and consists of a procedure schema, as well as a characterization schema.

Explore or edit the schema in [MetaConfigurator](https://metaconfigurator.github.io/meta-configurator/).
After clicking the link, navigate to the `Schema Editor` tab in the top left menu bar.
