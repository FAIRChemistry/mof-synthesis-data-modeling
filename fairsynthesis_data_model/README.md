# Data Model
1. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
3. open cmd / terminal, and change directory to this folder `fairsynthesis_data_model`. There you can use `uv run ...` as a substitution for `python ...` and everything you need will be installed.
4. New packages can be added using `uv add ...` instead of `pip install ...`.

## Contributing
- Best results using the vscode debugger are achieved by running `uv sync --all-packages`. Then just run `Python Debugger: Clear Cache and Reload Window` in the command palette.
